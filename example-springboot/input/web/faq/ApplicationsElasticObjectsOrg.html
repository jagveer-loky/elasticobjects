<h3>Is this Website Static?</h3>

<p>The url of this page is <strong>/faq/ApplicationElasticObjectsOrg.html</strong>. This looks static.
      But it's dynamic with a spring boot mvc web end point defined in
       #{GithubLinkCall->NONE, SP|web|WebEoGet.java}..
  </p>
<p>
    By the RequestMapping "/examples/{selectedItem:.+}" the createFaqPage method is triggered
    which calls the createPage method.
    Here  on the server side a new EO object is created and set some parameters
    like <em>selectedItem</em> or roles.
</p>
<p>
    Core parameter when
    execute EO is the call
     #{ConfigLinkCall->ModelConfig, TemplateResourceCall}. with the template
     #{GithubLinkCall->NONE, SPI|web|ContentPage.html}. for rendering.
</p>

<p>
    The same EO object can be send by the generic interface
     #{GithubLinkCall->NONE, SP|web|WebEo.java}. by a post method. At the end of each page
    the code and the used elements/configuration for this are under "This Page Elements".
</p>

<p>
This site is an application example for an application documentation where practicability of EO will be checked.

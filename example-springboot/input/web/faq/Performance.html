<h4>Performance</h4>
<p>
    A simple performance test with
     #{GithubLinkCall->NONE, EOTTR||performance-Mon%20Aug%2031%2008:49:57%20CEST%202020.info}.
    with
     #{GithubLinkCall->NONE, EOTT|performance|EOPerformance.java}.
    compare serialization and deserialization speed with
    <a href="https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson">Jackson</a> and
    <a href="https://github.com/google/gson">Gson</a>:

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Tool</th><th>toJson</th><th>fromJson</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>EO</td><td>1829 ms</td><td>478 ms</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>EO direct</td><td>602 ms</td><td>470 ms</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Jackson</td><td>118 ms</td><td>132 ms</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Gson</td><td>183 ms</td><td>111 ms</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>
    Serialization with
 #{GithubLinkCall->NONE, EO||EOToJSON.java}. is about 10 times slower.
Deserialization with
 #{GithubLinkCall->NONE, EO||JSONToEO.java}.
about 5 times.
</p>
<p>
    Performance had not the priority until now. The slowness in serialization is due to the fact,
    that that an
    object has to be wrapped by EO before serializing.
</p>
<p>
    Since EO allows more than just simple type mapping I suppose it will never reach the performance
    of the other frameworks.
</p>
<p>Compared with Jackson also untyped object trees can be deserialized. </p>

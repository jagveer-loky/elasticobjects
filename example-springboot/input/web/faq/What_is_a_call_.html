<h3>What is a call?</h3>
  <p>A
 #{ConfigLinkCall->ModelConfig, Call}. is just a special pojo extending
 #{ConfigLinkCall->ModelConfig, CallImpl}.
with a generic execute method with EO as input.

<p>
The attribute
         #{ConfigLinkCall->FieldConfig, sourcePath}.
        defines the location of the input value. The attribute
         #{ConfigLinkCall->FieldConfig, targetPath}.
        defines the output location.
</p>
<p>There are two conditions to be set. The attribute
         #{ConfigLinkCall->FieldConfig, startCondition}.
        is evaluated on the actual element.
The attribute
         #{ConfigLinkCall->FieldConfig, condition}.
        will be evaluated within
         #{ConfigLinkCall->FieldConfig, sourcePath}. location.
</p>
<p>If the attribute
         #{ConfigLinkCall->FieldConfig, duration}.
        is set, when the call is executed.
        It's just informal. If set, it the call will not be executed.
</p>
<p>There are no restriction, what could be implemented in an execution method.
        There are some really simple examples like the
    #{ConfigLinkCall->ModelConfig, SinusValueCall}..</p>
<p>The call works in a java application context when implemented.
        If a model configuration is defined, then the call can also be executed from a EO execute method.

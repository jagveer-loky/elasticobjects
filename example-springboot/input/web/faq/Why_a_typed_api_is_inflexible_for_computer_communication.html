<h3>Why a typed api is not good for computer communication?</h3>
<p>
        The typed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call">RPC</a> approach ties
        data and functionality together to a certain implementation and an url.
</p>
<p>
        Compared with human language this
        combination are simple sentences.
        For communication between client and server this means a fixed set of sentences available.
        If the client need something new or a modification this means a new endpoint with new configurations
        in a contract first world.
</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GraphQL">GraphQL</a> send
special messages through one generic endpoint.
        Those messages with its schemed rules are better adapted to database queries.
        The client decides how he combine things within these rules without changing the server side. </p>
<p>
        The concept of elastic objects is an enriched json as message. A simple
        type directive defines type and functionality. The combination of data and functionality is free.
        The functionality could be anything the server implements, e.g.
         #{ConfigLinkCall->ModelConfig, SinusValueCall}. or
         #{ConfigLinkCall->ModelConfig, TemplateCall}.
        or a
         #{ConfigLinkCall->ModelConfig, DbSqlReadCall}..
</p>

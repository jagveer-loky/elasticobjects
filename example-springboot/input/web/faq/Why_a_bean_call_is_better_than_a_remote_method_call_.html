<h3>Why a bean call is better than a remote method call?</h3>
<p>Why an object is better than a method?
</p>
<p>A method has just a list of fixed input values.
        Each new requirement needs a new method, new DTO objects, new endpoint or new versions.
</p>
<p>An object has instance vars which will be shown in a configuration
        and set when instantiated. With inheritance the implementation
        of a simple call is just an implementation of the execute method,
        since it's super class provide all necessary field variables.

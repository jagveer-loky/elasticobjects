<h5>The log for V0.4.0.</h5>
<p>
    <strong>
    Target of this version was to consolidate the configurations and to generate different sources
        from the excel file
        #{GithubLinkCall->NONE, BR||eo.xls}. again.
    </strong>
</p>
<p align="right"><em>1.10.2020</em>
<p>
    To simplify the lengthy links to
    <a href="https://github.com/fluentcodes/elasticobjects">&equiv;Github</a> there are now two new helper calls
    for the springboot demo:
    <ul>
    <li>
        #{GithubLinkCall->NONE, SP|calls.values|ConfigLinkCall.java}.</li>
    <li>
        #{GithubLinkCall->NONE, SP|calls.values|GithubLinkCall.java}.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
    One just have to embed 	@[GithubLinkCall->NONE, SP|calls.values|GithubLinkCall.java}. in the code to create the last link.
The first entry defines a module path as defined in
 #{GithubLinkCall->NONE, SP|calls.values|Modules.java}., the second the path within and the last
entry is code file.
</p>
<p>
    The
    #{GithubLinkCall->NONE, SP|calls.values|ConfigLinkCall.java}. will create a link to a
    configuration together with a github link.
</p>
<p>
    @{ConfigLinkCall->ModelConfig, GithubLinkCall}. will create the direct
    link to github and a internal link to the config page of this site:
    #{ConfigLinkCall->ModelConfig, GithubLinkCall}.
</p>
<p align="right"><em>19.9.2020</em>
</p>
<p>The configurations contains now one unmodifiable properties map. All tests are working.
The unmodifable version of map and list is added to the initial ModelConfig.
</p>
<p>
    They were extracted from the embedded classes in Collections directly from java. Think this could
    prevent accidentially changes of a configuration on a running system.
</p>
<p>
    The localFieldKeys in the model configuratione are now an unmodifiable list too. Two simple tests to check, if the unmodifiable
    values could not be changed.
</p>

<p align="right"><em>17.9.2020</em>
</p>
<p>Yesterday I've published the version 0.3.0 
    with the first generated json configurations from 
    the streamlined excel file
    #{GithubLinkCall->NONE, BR||eo.xlsx"}..
</p>

<p>
    With 0.3.0 the different configuration types e.g. for database access or Excel sheets 
    are removed introducing a configModelKey as a field. So one just have 
    the following sheets to generate the configurations:
</p>
<ul>

        <li>ModelConfig</li>
        <li>FieldConfig</li>
        <li>HostConfig</li>
        <li>FileConfig</li>
        <li>DbSqlConfig</li>
</ul>

<p>With 0.5.0 the the structure of the configuration with different immutable
    sub classes will be stream lined. This is some kind of over modelling but originally 
    comes from the idea to make the configuration immutable. 
</p>

<p>
    Another reason was to divide the properties to some kind of purpose. Length was 
    for example is a property used in database. But one can also use it in the set methods of
    the field. So a clean division is not generally given. 
</p>

<p>Since there is no general valid
    purpose of the properties, I will put it into one property map beside 
    those properties which are helpful for editing with filters. 
</p>

<p>
    Another reason is that when generating configurations or classes it depends 
    on the architecture you need additional properties. This could be e.g.
    endpoints for the web interface or some xml names. So a general purpose generator 
    could not have some kind of fixed properties. It must be adaptable to 
    the target framework/programming language. 
</p>

<p>
    This general filter purpose fields will be e.g. module. I think length i
    also a useful general valid information for filtering directly.
</p>

<p>
    There are some nice feature with Java 8 and default methods to get the property 
values with get/set methods. 
</p>

<p>
    With the move to the properties map I wanted to use some immutable 
    maps and lists since its configurations which should not be changed by 
    some mistake. 
</p>

<p>Unfortunately the java8 unmodifiable List and Map in Collections are
    just views of the embedded object with embedded static classes,
    actually not supported in EO.
</p>

<p>I took a look in the guava library with its immutable map and lists,
even it's general purpose huge with about 2,8 MB which would extend the size 
of the example-spring jar file even more.
</p>

<p>
    But to use "ImmutableMap" the rather simple map/list models have to 
    be extended since Guava use an implementation from the scratch.
</p>

<p>Actually I don't want to move to java9, where immutable maps
are provided out of the box. Several weeks ago I've moved from
    java 11 to java 8, since google cloud complains about java 11.
    As EO is a library which should not require a project to use java 11,
    I just decided to go back to a java 8.

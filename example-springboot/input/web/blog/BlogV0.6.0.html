<h5>The log for V0.6.0</h5>
<p>
    <strong>Target of this version was the refactoring the template directives and cleanup of the calls. </strong>
</p>
<p align="right"><em>24.10.2020</em></p>
<p>
    Another point of the discussion last week was how the
    directives are embedded in <a href="/examples/TemplateExamples.html">Templates</a>.
</p>
<p>Here I used <textarea>$[path]</textarea> for path values
    and some attribute pattern parsing
    <textarea>$[(call)path key1="value1" key2="value2"... keyN="valueN"/]</textarea> for calls.</p>


<h6>New Markups</h6>
<p>
    The task is to integrate typed JSON in
    some arbitrary text with a character combination for start and stop which has low probability to
    clash with existing programming code.
    Since it's content core is typed JSON I put curly brackets around. </p>
<p>
    The end pattern is a dot outside the bracket. If the markup has a content, it will set by a pipe.
</p>

<p>
    To emphasize the directives type I put a @ before. Every space and tab
    before this pattern and after a new line will be ignored. This makes
   the template more readable.
</p>
<p>
    A path value now will be set by
    <textarea>#{path}.</textarea>
</p>
<p>
    A JSON part will be embedded by
    <textarea>=@{JSON}.</textarea> or
    <textarea>=@{JSON}|content#{}.</textarea>
    The content could be set for calls implementing
    #{GithubLinkCall->ModelConfig, CallContent}.
</p>
<p>Here any combination of typed json could be set. If several calls are within,
    the content will set to the last call.</p>


<h6>Shorthand version</h6>

<p>
    As a short version of the JSON with one call there is the possibility to use the pattern
    <textarea>@{Call->value1, value2, ..., valueN}.</textarea>
    and
    <textarea>@{Call->value1, value2, ..., valueN}| ..content..#{}.</textarea>
    for calls with content.
</p>
<p>
    This shorthand version is similar to the attribute version and simplify the usage for simple calls like
    the often used

    #{ConfigLinkCall->ModelConfig, ConfigLinkCall}. :
    <textarea>@{ConfigLinkCall->ModelConfig, ConfigLinkCall}.</textarea>
</p>
<p>
    How the readability is changed could be shown in the
    #{ConfigLinkCall->FileConfig, table.tpl}. template.
    Beforehand this template was rather squeezed:
    <textarea style="height:100px"><table border="1">
<tr>$[(TemplateCall). sourcePath="0/*" ] <th>$[_parent]</th>$[/]</tr>
$[(TemplateCall)* ]<tr>$[(TemplateCall)* ] <td>$[_value]</td>$[/]</tr>$[/]
</table></textarea>

<p>
    Yesterday I had a little presentation in the company I worked before followed by some discussion.
    As expected GraphQL was mentioned. During the refinement of the database part there
    will one or the other topic emerge
    comparing how one would do it with GraphQL and with the Database Calls.
</p>
<p>
    The presentation struggled with packing too much in a short time.
    The basic questions emerged I try to answer
    with
    the two applications I develop on top of EO and too complex combined examples.
</p>
<p>
    As a conclusion I've realized I has to put some work in documentation. As a start I've tried to describe
    the two <a href="/faq/ApplicationsElasticObjects.org">applications</a>:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="/faq/ApplicationsElasticObjectsOrg.html">elasticobjects.org</a></li>
    <li><a href="/faq/ApplicationBuilder.html">code builder</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
    Finished V0.5.0 and deployed it.
